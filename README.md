# Project

Part of speech tagging.

## Description

Viterbi algorithm, and its application to part-of-speech (POS) tagging with unknown words

## Process

Estimating the transition probabilities and the emission probabilities of an HMM by Witten-Bell smoothing (Hidden Markov Model).

Applying UNK tags to unknown words in English, French, and Ukrainian to improve accuracy.

Using the Viterbi algorithm for testing.
