# Example of use.

# Two probabilities.
prob1 = 0.0001
prob2 = 0.000001

# Now represented as log probabilities.
logprob1 = log(prob1)
logprob2 = log(prob2)

# The log of the sum of the two probabilities.
logsummed = logsumexp([logprob1, logprob2])
 
# Converting log probability back to probability by exponentiation.
summed = exp(logsummed)
print("prob1 + prob2 =", summed)

# Multiplication of probabilities is simply by adding
# log probabilities together.
logmultiplied = logprob1 + logprob2
multiplied = exp(logmultiplied)
print("prob1 * prob2 =", multiplied)
